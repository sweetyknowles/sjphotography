        <h2>Photography is the best meditating passion!</h2>
        <p> If you love photography, then browsing through the gallery will not be as boring. I am by profession a Full Stack Develop. 
            I therefore, do develop applications and yes it can be nerve wrecking! 

            However, given the above stress of working, my favourtie time pass is my other passion PHOTOGRAPHY.
             Collecting memories, beautiful nature and giving people a palce to be beautiful is what I enjoy.
