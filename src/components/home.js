        <p> Yes, you read the above correctly. Photography is just not as simple as we like to think it is. When we try to see what our naked eye is seeing, the camera is thinking something else.
            That something else is angles, lighting, location, and most importantly how much can a lense can "actaully" cover.

            <p>These are all technical things, that require some amount of study and tons of practice. I have heard a few times, "if it appears beautiful image, then it probably is!" </p>

            <p>This is true, but only to a certain extend.</p>

            <p>We usually need help with the images by editing them. </p>
